PlaidLink provides indirect access to systems and processes protected by firewalls or behind other restrictions that make direct connections difficult.
By using an Agent installed within the isolated area, PlaidCloud can request the agent perform actions like running queries, downloading or uploading files, 
checking sensor conditions, interacting with SAP, and much more.

Since the agent initiates contact with PlaidCloud and communicates over standard HTTPS network protocols, it can normally operate with minimal setup.  In addition,
the agent can run as an unprivileged user to control access rights within a restricted environment.
