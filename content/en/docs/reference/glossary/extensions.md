Many cluster administrators use a hosted or distribution instance of PlaidCloud. These clusters come with extensions pre-installed. As a result, most PlaidCloud users will not need to install [extensions](/docs/concepts/extend-PlaidCloud/extend-cluster/#extensions) and even fewer users will need to author new ones.
