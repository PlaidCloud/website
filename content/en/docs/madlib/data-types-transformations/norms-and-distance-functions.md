## In SQL



```sql
madlib.squared_dist_norm2(a, b);
```


## In PlaidCloud Expressions & Filters



```python
func.madlib.squared_dist_norm2(a, b)
```

Apache MADLib Official Documentation for these methods can be found [here](https://madlib.apache.org/docs/latest/group__grp__linalg.html).



Additional capabilities and usage examples can be found in the Apache MADLib documentation.
