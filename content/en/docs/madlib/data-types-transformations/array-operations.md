## In SQL



```
madlib.array_add(array1,array2)
```


## In PlaidCloud Expressions & Filters



```
func.madlib.array_add(array1,array2)
```

Apache MADLib Official Documentation for these methods can be found [here](https://madlib.apache.org/docs/latest/group__grp__array.html).



Additional capabilities and usage examples can be found in the Apache MADLib documentation.
