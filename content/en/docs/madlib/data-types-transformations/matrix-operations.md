PlaidCloud expressions and filters provide use of most non-administrative Apache MADLib methods. Apache MADLib methods are accessed by prefixing the standard method name with `func.madlib.`.



## In SQL



```sql
madlib.matrix_trans('"mat_B"', 'row=row_id, val=vector', 'mat_r');
```


## In PlaidCloud Expressions & Filters



```python
func.madlib.matrix_trans('"mat_B"', 'row=row_id, val=vector', 'mat_r')
```
