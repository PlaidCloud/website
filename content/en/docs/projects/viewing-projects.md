## Description


Within **Analyze**, the Projects function provides a level of compartmentalization that makes controlling access and modifying privileges much easier. Projects are what provide the primary segregation of data within a workspace tab.



While Projects fall under Analyze, workflows fall under Projects, meaning that Projects contain workflows. Workflows, simply put, perform a wide range of tasks including data transformation pipelines, data analysis, and even ETL processes. More information on workflows can be found under the “Workflows” section.



## Accessing Projects


**To access Projects:**


1. Open Analyze
2. Select “Projects” from the top menu bar

This displays the Projects Hierarchy. From here, you will see a hierarchy of projects for which you have access. There may be additional projects within the workspace, but, if you are not an owner or assigned to the project, they will not be visible to you.
