PlaidCloud offers the ability to organize and manage hierarchies, including labels. Hierarchies are available to all workflows within a project.



PlaidCloud uses a path-based system to organize hierarchies, like you would use to navigate a series of folders, allowing for a more flexible and logical organization (control hierarchy) of the hierarchies. Using this system, hierarchies can be moved within a control hierarchy, or multiple references to one hierarchy, from different locations in the control hierarchy (alternate hierarchies) can be created. The ability to manage hierarchies using this method allows the structure to reflect operational needs, reporting, and control.



## Searching


To search for hierarchies:


1. Use the filter box in the lower left of the control hierarchy
2. The search filter will search hierarchy names and labels for matches and show the results in the control hierarchy above


## Move


To move a hierarchy within the control hierarchy:


1. Drag it into the folder where you wish to place it


## Rename


To Rename a Hierarchy:


1. Right click on the hierarchy
2. Select the rename option
3. Type in the new name and save it
4. The hierarchy is now renamed, but it will retain its original unique identifier


## Clear


You can clear a single hierarchy or multiple hierarchies.


To clear a hierarchy:


1. Select the hierarchies in the control hierarchy
2. Click the clear button on the top toolbar


## Delete


### You can delete a single hierarchy or multiple hierarchies.


To delete a hierarchy:


1. Select the hierarchies in the control hierarchy
2. Click the delete button on the top toolbar

The delete operation will check to see if the hierarchy is in use by workflow steps, tables, or views. If so, you will be asked to remove those associations.

You can also force delete the hierarchy(s). Force deletion of the hierarchy(s) will leave references broken, so this should be used sparingly.
