PlaidCloud offers the ability to organize and manage data editors, including labels. Data Editors allow editing table data or creating data by user interaction.



PlaidCloud uses a path-based system to organize data editors, like you would use to navigate a series of folders, allowing for a more flexible and logical organization (control hierarchy) of the data editors. Using this system, data editors can move within a control hierarchy. Multiple references to one data editor from different locations in the control hierarchy (alternate hierarchies) can be created. The ability to manage data editors using this method allows the structure to reflect operational needs, reporting, and control.




## Searching


To search for data editors:


1. Use the filter box in the lower left of the control hierarchy
