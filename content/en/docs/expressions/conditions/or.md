## Examples


**Example 1**


This example checks if the `period` is any of the three specified dates.



```
or_(  
    table.period == '2020_10',  
    table.period == '2020_11',  
    table.period == '2020_12'  
)
```


**Example 2**


This example is checking if `order_reason_Include` is `null` or has the word `KEEP` as a value.



```
or_(  
    table.order_reason_Include == 'KEEP',  
    table.order_reason_Include.is_(None)  
)
```
