Once you navigate to the **Workflows** tab in a project, click on the **New Workflow** button. This will open a form where you can enter in the details of the workflow including the name and memo.



In addition, you can set a remediation workflow to run if the workflow ends in an error. A remediation workflow does not need to be set but can be useful for sending notifications or triggering other processes that may automatically remediate failures.



Once the form is complete, click on the **Create** button and the new workflow will be added to the project.
