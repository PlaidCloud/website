You can trigger a full workflow run by either clicking on the run icon from the **Workflows** hierarchy or by selecting **Run All** from the **Actions** menu within a specific workflow.



You can also click on the **Toggle Start/Stop** button at the top of the workflow table. This toggle button will stop a running workflow or start a workflow.
