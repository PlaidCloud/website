Maintaining detailed documentation to support both statutory and management requirements is challenging when the projects and workflows may be dynamic. To help solve this problem, PlaidCloud provides a Workflow level report that provides detailed documentation of workflows, workflow steps, user defined functions, and variables.



The report is generated on-demand and reflects the current state of the workflow. To download the report click on the Report icon in the **Workflows** hierarchy.
