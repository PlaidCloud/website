There are two ways to update the order of steps in the workflow. The first way is to use the up and down arrows present in the **Workflows** table to move the step up or down. The second way is to use the **Step Move** option which allows you to move the step much easier if large changes are necessary. The step move option allows you to move the step to the top, bottom, or after a specific step in one operation.
