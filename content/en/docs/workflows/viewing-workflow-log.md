## Viewing the Workflow Log


As things happen within a workflow, such as steps running or warnings occurring, those events are logged to the workflow log. This log is viewable from the **Project** area under the **Log** tab. The workflow log is also present in the project log in case you would like to see a more comprehensive view of logs across multiple workflows.



The log viewer allows for sorting and filtering the log as well as viewing the details of a particular log entry.



## Clearing the Workflow Log


Clearing the workflow log may be desirable from time to time. From the log viewer, select the **Clear Log** button. This will clear the log based on the workflow selected which will also remove the log entries from the project level log too.
