While running individual steps is useful, it also may be useful to run subsets of an entire workflow for development, testing, or troubleshooting. To run a subset of steps, select all the steps you would like to run and select **Run Selected** from the **Actions** menu at the top of the workflow steps hierarchy. This will trigger a normal workflow processing but start the workflow at the beginning of the selected steps and stop once the last selected step is complete.
