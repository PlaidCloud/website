Workflow steps can be set to continue processing even when there is an error. This might be useful in workflow start-up conditions or where data may be available intermittently. If the step errors, it will be recorded as an error but the workflow will continue to process.



To set this option, click on the step edit option, the pencil icon in the workflow table, to open the edit form. Check the checkbox for **Continue On Error**. After saving the updated step, any errors with the step will not cause the workflow to stop.



Steps that have been set to continue on error will have a special indicator in the workflow steps hierarchy table.
