It may be useful to copy a workflow when planning to make major changes or to replicate the process with different options. Duplicating an entire workflow is very easy in PlaidCloud. Simply select the workflows you would like to duplicate in the **Workflows** table of a selected project and click the **Duplicate Selected Workflows** button at the top of the table. This will copy the workflows and append the word *Copy* to the name.



Once the duplication process is complete, the workflow is fully functional. Copied workflows are completely separate from the original and can be modified without impacting the original workflow.
