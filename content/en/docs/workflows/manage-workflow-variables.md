PlaidCloud allows variables at both the project scope and workflow scope. This allows for setting project wide variables or being able to pass information easily between workflows. The variables and values are viewed by clicking on the variables icon in the **Workflows** hierarchy.



From the variables table you can view the variables, the current values, and edit the values. You can also add new variables or delete existing ones.
