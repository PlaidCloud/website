Steps in the workflow can be set to skip during the workflow run. This may be useful if there are debugging steps or old steps that you are not prepared to completely remove from the workflow yet. To set this option, you have two options:


* Edit the step form
* Uncheck the enabled checkbox in the workflow hierarchy

To edit the step form, click on the step edit option, the pencil icon in the workflow table, to open the edit form. Uncheck the enabled checkbox. After saving the updated step it will no longer run as part of the workflow but can still be run using the single step run process.



Steps that have been set to disabled will have a disabled indicator in the workflow steps hierarchy table.
