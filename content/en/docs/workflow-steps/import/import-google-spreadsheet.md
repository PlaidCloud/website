## Unique Configuration Items

### Source Spreadsheet Selection

Accessing Google Spreadsheet data requires a valid Google user account. This requires set up in Tools. For details on setting up a Google account connection, see here: [PlaidCloud Tools â€“ Connection](/docs/tools/data-connections).

Once all necessary accounts have been set up, select the appropriate **Google Account** from the drop down list.

Next, specify the **Spreadsheet** to import from the dropdown menu containing all available files associated with the specified **Google Account**.

{{< note >}}
Make sure the provided user account has access to the specified file, especially if the file is owned by another user.

### Column Headers

{{< note >}}
Due to technical limitations, all columns from Google Spreadsheets are imported as String data type. Boolean, Numerical and/or Date/Time data types must be explicitly specified in the mapper.
