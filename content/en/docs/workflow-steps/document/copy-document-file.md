Copy a single file within PlaidCloud Document.



## File To Copy

Next, press the **Browse** button to select the file you’d like to copy.



## Select Destination


First, select the appropriate account from the dropdown menu.



Next, press the **Browse** button to select the destination for the copied file.



By default, Analyze will not allow files to be overwritten. Instead, a numerical suffix will be added to each subsequent copy. 



To overwrite the existing file, simply check the **Allow Overwriting Existing File** box.



To rename the file, check the **Rename the copied file to** box and type in a new name.

Be sure to provide a file extension when changing the name of the file. The file will be created successfully without an extension, but operating systems won’t know its type.
