# Description

# Copy Directory


First, select the appropriate account from the dropdown menu.



Next, press the **Browse** button to select the directory you’d like to copy.



# Select Destination


First, select the appropriate account from the dropdown menu.



Next, press the **Browse** button to select the destination for the copied directory. 



If desired, the copied directory can be given a new name. To do so, simply check the **Rename the Copied Folder to:** box and type in a new name.



*Important*

# Examples


In this example, the *etl\_prototyping/data\_files/* directory is copied into the *etl\_prototyping/* directory. It is renamed to *test\_copy\_2*.


As you can see below, the source and target directories have the same contents.



The copied directory’s files all contain the same timestamp as they were created during the copy.
