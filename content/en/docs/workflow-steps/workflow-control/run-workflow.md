## Description


“Run Workflow” runs an existing workflow.



## Workflow to Run


First, select the Project which contains the workflow to be run from the **Project** dropdown menu.



Next, select the particular workflow to be run from the **Workflow** dropdown menu.



Additionally, there is an option to **Wait until processing completes before continuing.** Selecting this checkbox will defer execution of the current workflow until the called workflow is completed with its execution. By default, this option is disabled, meaning that the current workflow in which this transform resides will continue processing in parallel along with the called workflow.
