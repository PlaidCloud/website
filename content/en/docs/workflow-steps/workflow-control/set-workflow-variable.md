## Description


“Set Workflow Variable” sets workflow variables for use during the workflow. A variable name and value may contain any combination of valid characters, including spaces. Variables are referenced within the workflow by placing them inside curly braces. For example, *a_variable* is referenced within a transform as *{a_variable}* so it could be used in something like a formula or field value (e.g. {a_variable} * 2).



## Variable List


The table will display the list of registered workflow variables and the current values. Enter the value for the variable desired. It’s also possible to set variable values without registering the variable first by simply adding the variable to the list.
