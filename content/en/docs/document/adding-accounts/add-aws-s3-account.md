## AWS S3 Setup


These steps need to be completed within the AWS console


1. Sign into or create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
2. Go to `All services > Storage > S3` in the console
3. Create a default or test bucket
4. Go to `All Services > Security Identity & Compliance > IAM > Users` in the console
5. Select the `Create User` button
6. When prompted, enter a username and select `Access Key - Programmatic access` only. Select the `Next: Permissions` button.
7. Select the option box called `Attach existing policies directly`
8. In the filter search box type `s3`. When the list filters down to S3 related items select `AmazonS3FullAccess` by checking the box to the left. Select the `Next: Tags` button.
9. Skip this step by selecting the `Next: Review` button
10. Select the plus icon next to the `WasabiFullAccess` policy to attach the policy to the user. Select the `Next` button.
11. Review the User settings and select `Create user`
12. Capture the keys generated for the user by downloading the CSV or copy/pasting the keys somewhere for use later. You will not be able to retrieve this key again so keep track of it. If you need to regenerate a key simply go back to step 5 above.

You should now have everything you need to add your S3 account to PlaidCloud Document.
