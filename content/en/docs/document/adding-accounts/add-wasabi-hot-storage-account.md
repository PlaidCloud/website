## Wasabi Hot Storage Setup


These steps need to be completed within the Wasabi Hot Storage console


1. Sign into or create a Wasabi Hot Storage account
2. Go to `Buckets` in the console
3. Create a default or test bucket
4. Go to Users in the console
5. Select the `Create User` button
6. When prompted, enter a username and select `Programmatic (create API key)` user
7. Skip the group assignment. Select the `Next` button
8. Select the plus icon next to the `WasabiFullAccess` policy to attach the policy to the user. Select the `Next` button.
9. Review the User settings and select `Create User`
10. Capture the keys generated for the user by downloading the CSV or copy/pasting the keys somewhere for use later. You will not be able to retrieve this key again so keep track of it. If you need to regenerate a key simply go back to step 5 above.
