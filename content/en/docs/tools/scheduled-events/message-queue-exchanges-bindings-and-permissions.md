## Users


In order to access messages in the message queue, you must first set up users. PlaidCloud allows you to create an unlimited number of users in order to suit your needs.

{{< note >}}
Because users can be granted permission to access multiple vHosts without needing different access levels, it is unnecessary to create one user for every vHost.

### Controlling User Access


The Admin Level setting provides the user with different privileges. PlaidCloud provides three levels of access:


* No Admin Access
* Management Admin Access
* Monitoring Admin Access

**No Admin Access** provides no administrative access but allows the user to utilize all other permission based access.



**Management Admin Access** provides full permission based access, as well as the following:


* List virtual hosts to which they can log in
* View all queues, exchanges, and bindings in “their” virtual hosts
* View and close their own channels and connections
* View “global” statistics covering all their virtual hosts, including activity by other users

**Monitoring Admin Access** provides everything “Management Admin Access” provides, as well as the following:


* List all virtual hosts, including ones they could not log into via AMQP
* View other users’ connections and channels
* View node-level data such as memory use and clustering
* View truly global statistics for all virtual hosts

### Deleting Users


**To delete a user:**


1. Open Analyze
2. Select the “Tools” menu
3. Hover over “Queueing” in the dropdown menu
4. Click “Users”
5. Click the delete icon of the desired user 


	* Click “Delete” again

{{< note >}}
Deleting a user will automatically remove all permissions granted to the user on all vHosts.
