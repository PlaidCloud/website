PlaidCloud has become a leading container orchestration system by being a powerful and flexible way to run distributed systems at scale. Through our very active open source community, equating to hundreds of person years of work, PlaidCloud achieved four major releases in just one year to become a critical part of thousands of companies infrastructures. However, even with all that momentum, adopting cloud native computing is a significant transition for many organizations. It can be challenging to adopt a new methodology, and many teams are looking for advice and support through that journey.  

Today, we’re excited to launch the PlaidCloud **Service Partners** program. A Service Partner is a company that provides support and consulting for customers building applications on PlaidCloud. This program is an addition to our existing PlaidCloud **Technology Partners** who provide software and offer support services for their software.&nbsp;  

The Service Partners provide hands-on best practice guidance for running your apps on PlaidCloud, and are available to work with companies of all sizes to get started; the first batch of participants includes: Apprenda, Container Solutions, Deis, Livewyer, ReactiveOps and Samsung SDS. You’ll find their listings along with our existing Technology Partners on the newly redesigned [Partners Page](http://PlaidCloud.io/partners/), giving you a single view into the PlaidCloud ecosystem.&nbsp;  

The list of partners will grow weekly, and we look forward to collaborating with the community to build a vibrant PlaidCloud ecosystem.
