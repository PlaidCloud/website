PlaidCloud 1.8 is live, made possible by hundreds of contributors pushing thousands of commits in this latest releases.  

The community has tallied more than 66,000 commits in the main repo and continues rapid growth outside of the main repo, which signals growing maturity and stability for the project. The community has logged more than 120,000 commits across all repos and 17,839 commits across all repos for v1.7.0 to v1.8.0 alone.  

With the help of our growing community of 1,400 plus contributors, we issued more than 3,000 PRs and pushed more than 5,000 commits to deliver PlaidCloud 1.8 with significant security and workload support updates. This all points to increased stability, a result of our project-wide focus on maturing [process](https://github.com/PlaidCloud/sig-release), formalizing [architecture](https://github.com/PlaidCloud/community/tree/master/sig-architecture), and strengthening PlaidCloud’ [governance model](https://github.com/PlaidCloud/community/tree/master/community/elections/2017).
