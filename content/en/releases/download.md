## Download PlaidLink

PlaidLink can operate as a Windows service, Unix/Linux/Mac daemon, docker container service, or as a Kubernetes pod.

Follow the [installation instructions](/plaidlink/setup/install) in the PlaidLink documentation to download and install the agent.


## Download PlaidCloud RPC Tools

The PlaidCloud RPC tools repo provides essential tools for connecting to and interacting with PlaidCloud in an efficient way.  While you can use standard OAuth and JSON-RPC requests, 
we have a set of utilities that make the whole experience a little easier to get started.

[View the PlaidCloud RPC Github Repo](https://github.com/PlaidCloud/plaid-rpc)

## Download PlaidXL

Ok, you don't actually download this one but we put it here for reference.  Follow the Microsoft App Store [installation instructions](/plaidxl/setup/install) in the PlaidXL documentation.
