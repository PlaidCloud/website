Organizations in PlaidCloud provide a top level area to control options such as single sign-on and member access capabilities. Organizations each contain at least one workspace, which allows workspaces to serve as the main level of tenant separation within PlaidCloud. A workspace helps to align teams with specific areas of interest and isolate access as appropriate. PlaidCloud allows Organizations to have an unlimited number of workspaces.



## Managing Organization Administrators


Each Organization in PlaidCloud can assign multiple administrators. Administrators have special privileges to control the Organization. They can do things such as manage billing, update access management, and perform workspace management. To manage administrators:


1. Select the “Organization Settings” menu from the top right of screen
2. Click “Administrators”

This will display the table of current administrators. After the table opens, you may add new administrators, delete existing administrators, or alter administrative privileges.
