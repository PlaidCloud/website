If retaining inactive members within PlaidCloud is not desired, members can be set for automatic removal from the Organization after a specified period of inactivity using the expiration capabilities PlaidCloud offers. This automated removal of dormant members can be set as short as one day, if desired.

{{< note >}}
Setting this option to zero (0) indicates no automated removal will occur for the Organization.
