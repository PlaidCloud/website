While members may be associated with other workspaces within an Organization, each workspace has it's own access restrictions. Members must be granted permission to view and access a workspace.



## Adding Members


To add a member:


1. Select “Organization Settings” from the menu in the upper right of the browser
2. Click “Workspaces”
3. Click the members icon
4. Select the desired member and drag them to the appropriate column
5. Click “Submit”

{{< note >}}
In order to add members to a workspace, the members must be part of the Organization and must appear on the member management form. If you want to add a member who does not appear on the member management form, you must first invite the member into the workspace.

To send an invite:


1. Select “Organization Settings” from the menu in the upper right of the browser
2. Click “Workspaces”
3. Click the invite icon

This process will send an email invitation to the member. The member then needs to click the link in the email and follow the directions to login or create an account if they are new to PlaidCloud. After a successful login, the member will be added to the workspace.



## Removing Members


To remove a member:


1. Select “Organization Settings” from the menu in the upper right of the browser
2. Click “Workspaces”
3. Click the members icon
4. Select the desired member and drag them to the appropriate column
5. Click “Submit”
