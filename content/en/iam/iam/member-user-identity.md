PlaidCloud makes authentication and role-based security easy to control from one centralized location: the “Identity” tab, located on the left side of the screen. Identity provides the foundation for member management, security, and different types of authentication processes.

Member management includes everything from viewing current members and adding new members to sending mass emails.

Security is a priority for PlaidCloud. The Security subset of the Identity tab allows you to perform security audits, set up security groups and default security groups for new members, and control the approved security level of each member.

Authentication is where security starts. PlaidCloud offers multiple authentication options to support most use cases:

* Password Only
* Two-Factor Authentication
* Single Sign-On
