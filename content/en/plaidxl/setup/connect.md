## For PlaidCloud Logins


Connecting to PlaidCloud is much like your login to PlaidCloud directly. You will be asked for your email, 
password, and any multi-factor authentication code enabled. Fill this out as normal, and begin using PlaidXL!



## For Single Sign-on Logins


If you normally use single sign-on to access PlaidCloud, the login process will be transparent for you as long 
as you are currently logged into your organization. If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to sign in.
