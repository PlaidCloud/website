### Remove non-ASCII Characters Option

By selecting this option, the import will remove any content that is not ASCII.  While PlaidCloud fully supports Unicode (UTF-8), real-world
files can contain all sorts of encodings and stray characters that make them challenging to process.

If the content of the file is expected to be ASCII only, checking this box will help ensure the import process runs smoothly.
